# Linux IT Support Troubleshooting Lab

This repository documents a hands-on Linux IT support lab built using Ubuntu Server. 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical, entry-level troubleshooting skills 
relevant to IT Support, Help Desk, and Junior Systems Administrator roles.

## Lab Environment
- OS: Ubuntu Server LTS
- Platform: VirtualBox
- Scope: Local virtual machine only (no exposed services)
- Focus: Realistic IT support incidents, not theory

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux user and permission management
- File system permissions
- Command-line troubleshooting
- Root cause analysis
- Safe corrective actions
- Verification and documentation

## Incident Documentation
Each incident follows a structured troubleshooting workflow:
1. User-reported issue
2. Issue reproduction
3. Diagnosis
4. Root cause identification
5. Resolution
6. Verification
7. Lessons learned

### Completed Incidents

## Repository Structure

- Baseline -  Environment setup and system baseline
- incidents - incident write-ups
- screenshots - Terminal screenshots for verification
- scripts - Supporting scripts


## Notes
- This project is intentionally minimal and iterative.
- Additional incidents will be added over time to reflect continued skill development.
